### Hi :wave:, I'm Mohamed El Kamhawi

I think about software design as an essential part of software development, a good design can save efforts and cost. that is why I pay a close attention designing a solution, focusing on the purpose of the system being developed, creating systems that can grow gracefully.

I speak Arabic, English, French, and Code 👨🏼‍💻
