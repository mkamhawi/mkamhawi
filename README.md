### Hi :wave:, I'm Mohamed El Kamhawi

I am a cloud solutions architect and manager with more than 10 years of experience in designing and developing software systems for various industries. I design and lead the development of software systems that are simple, extensible, and maintainable, using the latest technologies and best practices.

I also am a first line manager in the application engineering practice at IBM CIC Egypt. I work on growth initiatives for my company and the strategy of growing my team. I am always looking for new ways to improve our processes, products, and performance, as well as to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration.

I enjoy sharing my technical knowledge and learnings on my blog ( https://kamhawinotes.com/ ) and I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges.
