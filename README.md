### Hi :wave:, I'm Mohamed El Kamhawi

IBM MEA Quarterly Integrity Award winner, IBM Architect Profession Certified (L2 Expert), With over 12 years of software development experience, I am a First Line Manager and Cloud Solutions Architect at IBM's Client Innovation Center (CIC) in Egypt. I design and lead the development of cloud-native solutions for banking clients in the MEA region, using the latest technologies and best practices.

I also manage and mentor a team of engineers who are passionate, skilled, and collaborative. Together, we deliver high-quality software that meets the clients' needs and expectations, while also growing and learning from each other. I foster a culture of innovation and collaboration within my team and across the CIC, and I work on growth initiatives and strategies for my company and my practice.

I enjoy sharing my technical knowledge and learnings on my blog ( https://kamhawinotes.com/ ) and I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I have received multiple awards and recognitions from IBM for my performance and contribution to the CIC and the clients. I am also proficient in Arabic, English, and French.
